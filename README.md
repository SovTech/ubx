# UBU
The UBU is a crypto token of exchange that derives its value from unlocking inefficient assets in the current economic system. UBUs are issued on a daily fixed basis to anyone who elects to receive and trade them with participating vendors for goods & services. Every active citizen and vendor contributes to the value and stability of the system just by participating, releasing greater value into the economy which benefits everyone. The extent of this benefit is determined by the level of participation, but obviously people in low income groups derive the greatest relative benefit.
